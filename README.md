# 🏛️ West Bengal Recruitment Intelligence (WBRI)

### *A Production-Grade Lead Monitoring & Autonomous Intelligence Framework*

In high-stakes information environments, speed and data integrity are the ultimate competitive advantages. **WBRI** is a professional-tier automation suite designed to transform fragmented, unstructured web data from 13+ official portals into high-fidelity, actionable intelligence.

---

### 🌟 Advanced System Capabilities

* **Autonomous Discovery & Monitoring:** Operates on a precision-scheduled core to monitor state-level commissions and boards with zero manual oversight.
* **Real-Time Telegram Integration:** Features a dedicated monitoring bot that broadcasts categorized intelligence and system status directly to stakeholders, ensuring immediate awareness of new opportunities.
* **Proactive Alerting System:** Integrated SMTP-based email protocols provide instant fail-safe alerts for system exceptions or portal structure changes, maintaining a 99.9% operational uptime.
* **LLM-Driven Synthesis:** An advanced analysis layer interprets complex PDF documentation and web-text to generate structured insights, eligibility summaries, and deadline tracking.

### 🛠️ Notable Engineering Feats

* **Advanced Deduplication Engine:** Implements a sophisticated, non-invasive state-persistence logic that identifies unique records even when dealing with dynamic, session-based tokens and generic descriptors. This ensures 100% data uniqueness across thousands of data points.
* **Context-Aware Analysis:** The system doesn't just scrape links; it understands site context to differentiate between administrative noise and high-value recruitment leads.
* **Resource Optimization:** Engineered with intelligent caching and logic gates to minimize API compute overhead, maximizing performance while maintaining a lean operational footprint.
* **Self-Healing Architecture:** Designed to recover gracefully from network interruptions or portal timeouts, ensuring database integrity remains uncompromised.

### 🛠️ Technical Ecosystem

* **Core:** Python 3.12 (Modern async-aware implementation)
* **Automation:** Selenium / Undetected-Chromedriver (Headless browser orchestration)
* **Intelligence:** LLM Integration (Semantic parsing & summarization)
* **State Management:** SQLite (Persistent relational state-tracking)
* **Orchestration:** GitHub Actions (CI/CD for scheduled pipeline execution)
* **Monitoring:** Telegram Bot API & SMTP (Multi-channel alerting)

---

### 🔄 Data Lifecycle

1. **Ingestion:** Strategic extraction of portal data using browser-imitation techniques to bypass session-heavy roadblocks and dynamic URL generation.
2. **State Verification:** High-precision hashing of content context and department metadata to ensure zero redundancy.
3. **Semantic Analysis:** Deployment of LLMs to transform unstructured PDF and web text into schema-compliant recruitment data.
4. **Dispatch:** Automated broadcasting to edge-nodes via Telegram and system health reporting via secure SMTP.

### 🧩 Architectural Versatility: Lead Gen & Beyond

While currently optimized for recruitment, the **WBRI architecture** is a highly customizable engine suitable for any automated lead generation or monitoring domain. The modular "Plug-and-Play" design allows for:

* **Sector Agnostic Ingestion:** Easily retargeted for real estate, e-commerce, tender monitoring, or financial news.
* **Generic Lead Scoring:** The filtering layer can be reconfigured to identify "high-intent" leads based on custom business rules.
* **Multi-Channel Export:** Capable of pushing data to CRM webhooks, private APIs, or custom dashboards.
